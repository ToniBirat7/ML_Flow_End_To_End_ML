    "## **MLFlow in AWS (Try It)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run MLflow in AWS, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up an EC2 instance**: Launch an EC2 instance with the desired specifications. Make sure to configure the security group to allow inbound traffic on the port you will use for MLflow (default is 5000).\n",
    "2. **Install MLflow**: SSH into your EC2 instance and install MLflow using pip:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install mlflow\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Run MLflow server**: Start the MLflow server on your EC2 instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mlflow ui\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access MLflow UI**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:5000` to access the MLflow UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Configure tracking URI**: In your MLflow scripts, set the tracking URI to point to your EC2 instance:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import mlflow\n",
    "   mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:5000\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "6. **Log experiments**: Use MLflow's logging functions in your scripts to log parameters, metrics, and models as you would normally do.\n",
    "7. **Persist data**: If you want to persist your MLflow data, you can set up a remote storage backend (like S3) for MLflow artifacts and models. You can configure this in your `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` call or by setting environment variables.\n",
    "8. **Security**: Consider securing your MLflow server by setting up authentication and HTTPS. You can use tools like Nginx or Apache to set up a reverse proxy with SSL.\n",
    "9. **Monitoring and Scaling**: For production use, consider using AWS services like CloudWatch for monitoring and Auto Scaling for handling increased load.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "10. **Backup**: Regularly back up your MLflow data and models to ensure you don't lose any important information.\n",
    "```\n"

    "## **Apache Airflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intro**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to define complex data pipelines as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using Python code. Airflow provides a rich user interface to visualize the execution of tasks, monitor their status, and manage dependencies between tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Apache Airflow, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install apache-airflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**: A DAG is a collection of tasks with dependencies defined between them. In Airflow, you define your workflows as DAGs using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Operators**: Operators are the building blocks of Airflow tasks. They define what kind of work a task will do. There are different types of operators for various tasks, such as BashOperator for running bash commands, PythonOperator for executing Python functions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tasks**: A task is a single unit of work within a DAG. Each task is represented by an instance of an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scheduler**: The Airflow scheduler is responsible for executing tasks on a defined schedule. It monitors the DAGs and triggers tasks based on their dependencies and schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Executor**: The executor is the component that actually runs the tasks. Airflow supports different executors, such as the LocalExecutor for running tasks locally and the CeleryExecutor for distributed task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **UI**: Airflow provides a web-based user interface to visualize and manage your workflows. You can view the status of tasks, trigger runs, and monitor progress through the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example DAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from airflow import DAG\n",
    "from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\n",
    "from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_task():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, Airflow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "with DAG(\"my_dag\", schedule_interval=\"@daily\", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1)) as dag:\n",
    "    start = DummyOperator(task_id=\"start\")\n",
    "    task1 = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task1\", python_callable=my_task)\n",
    "    end = DummyOperator(task_id=\"end\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    start >> task1 >> end\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Running Airflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Airflow, you need to initialize the database and start the web server and scheduler. Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Initialize the database\n",
    "airflow db init\n",
    "# Start the web server\n",
    "airflow webserver --port 8080\n",
    "# Start the scheduler\n",
    "airflow scheduler\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Accessing the Airflow UI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the web server is running, you can access the Airflow UI by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. From there, you can view your DAGs, trigger runs, and monitor task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Airflow with MLFlow**\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate Airflow with MLflow, you can create Airflow tasks that log experiments, parameters, and metrics to MLflow. This allows you to track your machine learning experiments and manage them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from airflow import DAG\n",
    "from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "import mlflow\n",
    "\n",
    "def log_experiment():\n",
    "  mlflow.start_run()\n",
    "  mlflow.log_param(\"param1\", 5)\n",
    "  mlflow.log_metric(\"metric1\", 0.85)\n",
    "  mlflow.end_run()\n",
    "\n",
    "with DAG(\"mlflow_integration\", schedule_interval=\"@daily\", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1)) as dag:\n",
    "  log_task = PythonOperator(task_id=\"log_experiment\", python_callable=log_experiment)\n",
    "  log_task\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This DAG defines a task that logs parameters and metrics to MLflow. You can run this DAG in Airflow to track your machine learning experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Airflow for MLOps?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Airflow is a powerful tool for managing complex workflows and data pipelines, making it an excellent choice for MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). Here are some reasons why Airflow is suitable for MLOps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Airflow allows you to define complex workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), making it easy to manage dependencies between tasks and ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Task Scheduling**: Airflow provides a robust scheduling mechanism that allows you to run tasks at specific intervals or based on triggers, making it ideal for automating machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extensibility**: Airflow supports a wide range of operators and hooks, allowing you to integrate with various tools and services commonly used in MLOps, such as MLflow, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Airflow provides a web-based user interface to monitor the status of tasks, view logs, and track the progress of workflows. This is crucial for debugging and maintaining machine learning pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: Airflow can scale horizontally by using distributed executors like Celery or Kubernetes, allowing you to handle large-scale machine learning workloads efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Version Control**: Airflow allows you to version your DAGs and tasks, making it easier to manage changes to your machine learning workflows over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Astro With Airflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Astro is a managed service for Apache Airflow that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of Airflow instances. It provides a user-friendly interface and integrates with various cloud services, making it easier to run and manage Airflow workflows in production.\n",
    "\n",
