# End-to-End ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow as the orchestration engine. The pipeline extracts astronomical data from NASA's public API, processes it through transformation steps, and loads the refined data into a PostgreSQL database for analysis and reporting.

## Problem Statement

Modern data engineering requires robust, scalable, and automated pipelines that can handle real-world data sources reliably. This project addresses the challenge of building an end-to-end data pipeline that can:

- Extract data from external APIs with proper error handling
- Transform raw data into meaningful, analysis-ready formats
- Load processed data into a relational database
- Orchestrate the entire workflow with scheduling and monitoring capabilities
- Maintain data quality and pipeline reliability

## Project Scope

### Data Source

The pipeline utilizes NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API, which provides comprehensive data about asteroids and their close approaches to Earth. This real-world data source offers:

- Daily updated asteroid tracking information
- Rich metadata about asteroid characteristics
- Orbital and approach data for scientific analysis
- Publicly accessible REST API endpoints

### Pipeline Architecture

The ETL pipeline follows a three-stage architecture:

1. **Extract Phase**: Automated data retrieval from NASA's API with robust error handling and retry mechanisms
2. **Transform Phase**: Data cleaning, validation, and aggregation processes including calculation of average asteroid sizes and standardization of measurement units
3. **Load Phase**: Structured data insertion into PostgreSQL database with proper schema design and indexing

### Technology Stack

- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data storage
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing
- **NASA NeoWs API**: External data source

## Key Features

### Containerized Environment

The entire pipeline runs in a containerized environment using Docker, ensuring:

- Consistent development and production environments
- Easy deployment and scaling
- Isolated service dependencies
- Simplified configuration management

### Inter-Service Communication

The project demonstrates advanced Docker networking concepts:

- Container-to-container communication between Airflow and PostgreSQL
- Network isolation and security best practices
- Service discovery and connection management
- Port mapping and internal networking

### Airflow Integration

Advanced Airflow features implemented:

- Custom hooks for external system connections
- XCom for inter-task data passing
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Task dependency management
- Scheduling and monitoring capabilities

### Data Quality Assurance

The pipeline includes comprehensive data validation:

- API response validation and error handling
- Data type checking and conversion
- Missing value handling strategies
- Data consistency verification
- Logging and monitoring for data quality metrics

## Business Value

### Scientific Research

The processed asteroid data enables:

- Trend analysis of near-Earth object approaches
- Statistical modeling of asteroid characteristics
- Historical tracking and pattern recognition
- Risk assessment for planetary defense

### Technical Learning

The project serves as a comprehensive learning platform for:

- Modern data engineering practices
- Workflow orchestration with Airflow
- Containerized application deployment

- Documentation and testing frameworks

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed with scalability in mind:

- Modular task design for easy extension
- Configurable scheduling and resource allocation
- Database optimization for large datasets
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Error recovery and data backfill strategies

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, users will understand:

- End-to-end data pipeline design principles
- Apache Airflow workflow orchestration
- Docker containerization for data applications
- API integration and error handling
- Database design for analytical workloads
- Data quality and validation strategies
- Production deployment considerations

This project serves as a practical foundation for building production-ready data pipelines and demonstrates industry-standard practices in modern data engineering.
